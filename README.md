Hello my name is Ryan Reed, an aspiring Data Scientist. This page is a place for me to build, test, and learn new ideas. Currently I am interested in building projects that can help people in the medical world.
However, this will probably change, as I like to adapt to new and exciting challenges. If you would like to reach out to me, you can email me at Ryan.reed.637.1@gmail.com.
